The company provides home services via online discovery platform. The data contains transactional data for the last 12 months (December 2017 to November 2018).
Each row corresponds to one transaction (transaction/order/request will be used interchangeably) placed by a customer tracked by "Transaction_ID" unique to the order placed.

1.Plot new users acquired every month on a bar chart (New user in a month = a customer who has placed a request for the first time in this month)

"2.30-Day repeat rate is defined as percentage of new users who have placed a 2nd order within 30 days of placing their first order.
What is the 30-day repeat rate of users acquired in December 2017?"

3.What is the 90-day repeat rate of users acquired in Jan,Feb,March 2018?

4.Plot the distribution of users by frequency of their 90-day repeat (Number of times user repeated within first 90 days)
